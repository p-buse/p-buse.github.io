Drawn to You is a game I worked on as part of Team Sheeps for the [Global Game Jam 2015][ggj]. It's heavily influenced by a Jason Rohrer game called [Passage][passage]. The game deals with the inevitability of sickness and death. Over time, one player becomes sick. If you leave them behind, they're gone forever. The [full source code][sourcecode] is on GitHub, and you can play it here or at [greendoorgames.com][greendoorgames]
