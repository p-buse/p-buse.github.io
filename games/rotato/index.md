In Rotato, you play as a potato with the psychic ability to rotate your immediate surroundings. I worked in a team of four, and we all liked difficult and mind-bendings platformers, like [Super Meat Boy][smb], [Braid][braid], and [Trine][trine]. We wanted to do something with space manipulation as a main mechanic, and we settled on rotation. The challenges in Rotato come from environmental hazards, rather than enemies. I hope you enjoy it!
