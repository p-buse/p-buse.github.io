In Rotato, you play as a potato with the psychic ability to rotate your immediate surroundings. I worked in a team of four as part of Oberlin College's Game Design class. My group was drawn to difficult and mind-bendings platformers, like [Super Meat Boy][smb], [Braid][braid], and [Trine][trine]. We wanted to make something with space manipulation as a main mechanic, and after prototyping several different mechanics, we chose rotation. The challenges in Rotato come from environmental hazards, rather than enemies.
