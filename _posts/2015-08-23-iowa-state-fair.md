title: Iowa State Fair & More
description: Crowded, but comfortable

Arrived at the Peaceful Haven B&B (found on AirBnB) last night. We opened the door with the code we'd been given to find an empty house with the TV on (Golf Channel). Coincidentally, our host, Susan, pulled up with her husband Todd as we stepped back outside towards the car, confused. Susan was friendly even by Midwestern standards, and showed us around her home, in which she rents out four rooms.

Dinner was at a Mexican restaurant called Old West, packed to the gills with sunburnt-looking families. Three people had birthdays: a large hat was placed over their head and the wait staff sang to them. The food was delicious. We got rained on while coming and going (and there was a pesky tornado watch), but it was worth the trip.

In the morning, Dan and I had breakfast with three other guests at the Haven: Minette, her husband Dan, and their friend Anne. Minette and Dan were here to see their newborn grandson, and so was Anne, but they hadn't prearranged to meet at the B&B. Only by coincidence did they meet up with each other. Dan (big Dan, not [Dan Barella](http://barel.la)) was very interested in genealogy, and told us he'd traced his lineage to King Henry I. He'd had his DNA analyzed by [Ancestry.com](http://ancestry.com) and found out he's about 50% English, and a mix of Scottish, German, Scandinavian, and maybe French. Anne told us about her father, who was from Canada. His parents died when he was very young. He remembered being under the kitchen table with his sister (Anne's aunt) listening to their extended family debate where to send him. Amazing breakfast conversation, and oh, what little life experience I have.

On the map, the State Fairgrounds looked small; I was wrong about that. Dan and I parked at a garage in downtown Des Moines and took a shuttle bus to the fairground. The bus's destination sign had only one stop: *1: FAIR*. People with houses near the fairground had put out signs saying *PARK HERE - $10* or *FAIR PARKING $5*. One house had a black and red *NO PARKING* sign in each window. Just outside the fairgrounds, a Ben Carson for President billboard greeted us.

Dan and I got $6 admission because it was "Extreme Sunday" (the last day of the fair). The grounds were crowded, but not packed. There were families, couples, farmers in plaid shirts and overalls, too many strollers to count, crying children, sleeping babies, tank topped bros, many Iowa State and Ohio State shirts. I can't really summarize the things that happened there, there were just too many. It was like part Disneyland and part shopping mall (redundant, maybe), part carnival and part agriculture showcase. It was difficult finding something not deep fried for lunch (not to say that I dislike fried foods. In fact, the first thing I ate at the fair was a deep-fried Snickers bar).

Resting at a picnic bench in the shade beside a road, I saw an ambulance inch its way down a main drag, people slowly moving out of its way. A guy with long hair handed me a pamphlet inviting me to accept Jesus and said, "God bless you, sir." Then he moved on to the next person on the next picnic bench. It seemed like the pamphlet had been hastily made. Each page seemed to continue from a previous section that didn't exist, and ran off the length of the page but didn't continue.

Of course I rode the Giant Slide.

There were microphones set up above the slide to broadcast the screams of its riders.

In the John Deere Agriculture Building, giant posters lauded the hard work of Iowan farmers. "You can't eat without us," was basically their message.

This was also, of course, the home of the famous Butter Cow, a giant cow made out of butter to help sell beef products. Alongside the cow was a display how wonderfully efficient beef is, by way of a protein-to-calories ratio.

Upstairs, live honeybees crawled around inside several clear-plastic enclosures. I asked a man working about what it means to be an [Iowa Honey Queen](http://www.abuzzaboutbees.com/beehive/queen-program.html). Apparently, the Honey Queens are (young women) beekeepers who travel around and talk about the importance of bees and honey.

Another unusual competition: Doll House and Miniature Room.

These doll houses are excruciatingly detailed, and include written descriptions of their inhabitants' world.

Outside, a man carved sculptures with a chainsaw.

The William C. Knapp Varied Industries Building was like an enormous SkyMall retail demonstration. Vendors wearing headset microphones pitched their products to live audiences. A crowd gathered around three blindfolded, headphone-wearing people receiving machine-automated Aqua Massages. An automatic sewing machine created an intricate design on a piece of fabric. I asked the ladies working the booth for the price; they told me these machines cost upwards of $2,200, but the one on display was $10,000.

In the building's lobby, a sculpture celebrating Iowa agriculture featured two sheep, one of which had a disturbingly human grin. Dan imitated it.

We headed down to the Midway to check out the carny games and rides. I was interested in having my stomach flipped upside-down, and was disappointed to learn that not only did **Tickets** cost $1 each (or 25 for $20), but each ride required multiple **Tickets**. Dan and I settled for watching others be strapped into harnesses and dropped, flung, or centrifuged. The ring toss made me smile: no one ever wins. Even if they did, I know the prizes cost less than the tickets. Surely then, it must be about the fun?

But I'm getting too philosophical. A fun day at the fair. And an urge to lay down in a quiet place and be alone afterwards.
