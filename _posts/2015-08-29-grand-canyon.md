title: Grand Canyon: One Big Canyon
description: More than just a hole in the ground!
---

Dan and I met up with our friends Nora and Noah at the south rim of the Grand Canyon, where Noah works in *Science and Resource Management* (that's what we told the park ranger to avoid the vehicle fee). It's a nice gig—the National Park Service puts Noah up in housing near the Grand Canyon and Noahs gets to do interesting research with nerdy people. The hours can be crazy; Noah told us about 17-hour days going into the field at 4am, getting back at 9pm. You get to know your coworkers well. Very well. Noah lives with a coworker, and I was told this is discouraged for reasons of (inter)personal sanity. (Although it seems to be working out well for them!)

Noah took us to a secluded viewing area to gaze at the Canyon. It was Dan's first time seeing it, and as we drove by the "corridor trails" ([Bright Angel, North Kaibab, and South Kaibab](http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/trail-distances.htm)) we told him not to peek so he'd be utterly flabbergasted when he saw the thing.

Some people were getting married at our spot! A photographer took pictures of two well-dressed people, one in a white dress. Under a wooden lean-to, others set the tables with white tablecloths. Clear plastic urns held beverages, and I imagine some nice hors d'oeuvres were in order. We probably weren't supposed to be there, but...

The view was spectacular. Noah pointed out where they worked in the Canyon, the names of the peaks, distances between points.<sup id="1-footnote-inline">[1](#1-footnote-bottom)</sup> Unfortunately we arrived too late to watch the sun go behind the horizon, but we did get to catch the moon (it was orange) come up from behind a distant cliff.

We had dinner at the dining hall, which was packed with tired-looking tourists. In the car, after dinner, Noah explained that the National Park Service had been grappling with Xanterra, its food service provider at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon (and elsewhere). In my opinion, it sounds like the NPS messed up, and Xanterra tried to take advantage of the situation. You can read more about it by googling "xanterra lawsuit."

When we got back to Noah's place, it was time to make a bonfire. Robin and Hampton, Noah's coworkers, argued over how to do it. Eventually we got it flaming and didn't even have to use gasoline! We sat on logs and chairs in the backyard and shot the shit until it got late and I got tired.

In the morning, although Noah tried to keep us forever, we left for Los Angeles. On the road again!

<b id="1-footnote-bottom">1</b>Noah had worked as a PSAR (Preventative Search and Rescue) on some of the longer trails, and told me that the most commonly injured group of people is "young athletic males," who overconfidently get heat exhaustion. [↩](#1-footnote-inline)
