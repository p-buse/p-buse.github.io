title: Pioneer Village to Boulder
description: The progress of man... or at least his cars

Woke up to grab a continental breakfast in the Pioneer Village office, where Fox News played on a small CRT television. After breakfast, Dan and I went to the main attraction: the Pioneer Village Museum. There were about four or five cars parked outside. Inside, it wasn't crowded; for the most part we had the place to ourselves.

The museum is broken up into twenty-something buildings, the first one the largest and containing the most American Stuff. The woman selling tickets let us know that if we wanted to see the entire museum, we could follow the white lines painted on the ground.

The first part of the museum showcased the evolution of transportation.

I enjoyed seeing the old advertisements. It's funny to me what companies choose to showcase about their products.

Before QWERTY, there was this.

In the 1890s, people had a dark sense of humor.

Two 1870s-era statues by the sculptor John Rogers.

The statues are the same except for the man's facial hair! Early personalization. I'd seen pictures of these statues (or "Rogers Groups," as those *in the know* call them) online, and I was surprised by how big they are in real life: almost two feet tall!

The museum's stated goal is to display "the story of America and how it grew." But it also purports to show the progress of all humankind. These two narratives get melded together into a mashup of American-technological-progress-as-human-progress. Plus, there's some killer mid-century snark.

Dan and I worked our way through the history of cars, boats, planes, typewriters (and computers), telephones, clothing, and guns before we made it through the first building. We were in a hurry, so we hustled through the rest of the museum, but not before touring the outdoor courtyard.

The buildings in the courtyard either displayed items with a similar theme (hobbies, housework, or firefighting, for example), or were recreations of buildings from the 19th century. The firehouse showcased the evolution of the fire extinguisher. A frontier home made out of sod was remarkably cool and clean inside. A one-room schoolhouse (two rooms if you count the entryway) bore a striking resemblance to classrooms today. Unfortunately, the merry-go-round wasn't operating.

In the "Homes and Shops Buildings," we found a woman spinning yarn on a pedal-powered wheel. She wasn't dressed in period clothing and she didn't pretend to be from the 1890s, but she did legitimately run her own wool business. She was happy to tell us about her 100+ sheep, ewes, alpacas, and other fuzzy mammals. She also let us in on a little secret: "Department store sweaters are always horrible. They use the worst wool, always from the ass and the shoulders. My sons bought me one of those things. Now I wear it each Christmas and that's it. Don't go buying your mom one of those. Get on Etsy and get something nice. She'll know the difference."

She sells her wool to a woman in Maine who makes "heritage quilts." I was going to ask what those were but she started explaining.
"It's kind of morbid, but it can also be nice. People send her their deceased family members' clothing, and this woman makes a quilt from it."

She let us feel the various wools that she'd made and told us which animals they'd come from. We were anxious to get going, so we thanked her for the demonstration and moved on.

We blazed through the rest of the museum, but not before checking out the pianos and other musical instruments, ham radios, old presidential campaign buttons, stoves, ovens, washers/dryers, and a freakishly huge pen collection.

With that, we were on the road again. And we had a tasty lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
