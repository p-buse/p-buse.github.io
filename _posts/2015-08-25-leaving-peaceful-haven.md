Dan and I woke up extra early on to have breakfast with my friend Alex B. at the Drake Diner. She's going into her senior year at Oberlin as an English major. I considered majoring in English, but decided that I wanted a major with a future. Just kidding.

We caught up on where we'd been and what we'd been up to. Alex spent her last semester in Cordoba, Spain, and had been building an elaborate scrapbook (which, in some sense, is ths blog's function). We realized that we all had various "scraps" we'd kept over the years. Dan had saved all his travel paraphanelia: tickets, Unaccompanied Minor badges and holders, various printouts, everything since he first started traveling when he was ten years old.

While we were eating, a man approached us and said he noticed my Oberlin shirt and was an alumnus, class of 1963. He introduced himself as Delbert Spurlock, and asked me what year I was at Oberlin. I explained that Dan and I just graduated and were going to work at Google, and Alex was going into her senior year. He said he had worked in civil rights law before working for the United States Army, then asked us what we were doing to keep the Oberlin spark of social justice alive. I said my goal was to understand how things work, and that my starting assumption was that I knew nothing. He neither affirmed nor pooh-poohed this idea, and told us good luck, and we wrapped up our conversation.

We were anxious to get on the road, but not before getting a tour of Alex's Family's RV. I had never been inside an RV; most of the ones I'd seen were in museums (because someone famous lived in them) or at rest stops. Alex's Family's RV could expand its two main walls to create a large-ish space inside. This is probably a common feature on most RVs, but it amazed Dan and me. Reversing the process to make the vehicle drivable created the sensation of being trapped in a trash compactor or other shrinking receptacle. We all piled out, said our goodbyes, and Dan and I hit the road.

After some hours of driving through extremely flat terrain, we arrived in Minden, Nebraska.

Dan and I stayed at the Pioneer Village Motel, which granted us one free ticket to the Pioneer Village Museum.

I'd like to say that Dan and I just *found* the Minden Swimming Pool on our own. But the real reason was that I was looking up real estate prices. One home said "close to pool and park," and Dan and I drove over and checked it out.

Two middle-aged women stood outside the entrance. They seemed to be the only people there. Dan and I introduced ourselves and said we were on a road trip. They introduced themselves as Lisa and Ginny. Lisa's daughter was headed to the pool to teach a water aerobics class and Ginny was there to participate in the class. Lisa asked us where we were staying. When we told them we were staying at the Pioneer Village Motel, they laughed and said they felt sorry for us.
"They're having some financial troubles," said Lisa. "It hasn't been as well kept-up."
"It looks like it's from the sixties," I said. Ginny laughed.
"It probably hasn't been renovated since the sixties," she said.

We chatted with them about the differences in climate between New York, Boston, and Nebraska, and asked for recommendations for things to do (eat at Runza's, visit the archway over I-80, and see the Pioneer Village Museum) and finally popped the question: could we go swimming? Lisa said it was up to her daughter and the women who were doing aerobics, but it would probably be fine. And when she arrived and we asked her, she said, "Yeah, sure. I'll charge you guys $2 each."

The water was heavenly. It was hot outside and it felt great to cool off. The group of middle-aged women doing water aerobics didn't seem to mind Dan and I swimming laps in the deep end. After a while, the ladies wanted to use the deep end for their aerobics.
"Time to switch," called Ginny. Dan and I started swimming to the other side of the pool. "Unless you want to join us," she added.
"No, he doesn't," another woman called, and the ladies laughed.

After we got out and paid our fee, Dan and I went to El Agave, a Mexican restaurant that both Lisa and the man at the Pioneer Village Motel office had recommended.

This is the second Mexican restaurant staffed by Mexican workers in the Midwest that Dan and I have gone to. A quick Google search revealed that Latino immigration to the Midwest has been going on for quite a while. I wouldn't have guessed; I usually think of Latino immigrants settling in border states.

After dinner, Dan and I walked around the town center.

The hardware store (and Mall, which looked unoccupied).

The opera house.

The courthouse.

And finally, we returned back to the motel.

And crashed for the night.
